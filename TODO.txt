TODO:
create fruits
 - for now, create numbered fruits and you can have eight
 - assign to card
 - move fruit with vertical north-facing card

----
Elevator pitch: remake Orchard in PICO-8

MVP 1 objective: decide user navigation 

MVP 1:
- move card-holder
- rotate card-holder

MVP 2:

- create cards (arrays of fruit)
- initialize card-holder with a card
	- fruits should move and roate with card. Use simple/visually informative sprites
- activate card (plant fruit)
- assign another card to cartd holder
	- for now, have card slide in from top right

MVP 3:
- add score
- add simple dots to represent fruit/growth
- implement rules for growth/scoring

THEN SEND OUT :)

Other:
- bring up item select (fullscreen, draft version with just two cards for now)
- create a border - it should use the current trees placed to detremine maximum widths/heights
