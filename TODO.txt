In progress:
- change rules so that cards can only be placed when overlapping fruit
    - this will change the is_plantable/is_placable function
    - card will now loop through all its fruits and ask if each fruit is_growable
    - to check if a fruit is growable, it will check itself against all planted fruit
    and return true if it overlaps and matches with a planted fruit
    - each fruit will also have an is_plantable function, This will return true if the
    fruit overlaps with nothing
    - so now a card can be placed if:
        - it has at least one growable fruit
        - and there are no non-growable or non-plantable fruits
    - and now you can use is_growable to highlight growable fruits, ie you can get rid of the
    code that "marks" fruits as growable (cos now you can just ask a fruit itself)

Other:
- create gifs with instructions for webpage that game is hosted on
    - mention this in-game 
    - mention edge-screen-scrolling
- bring up item select (fullscreen, draft version with just two cards for now)
