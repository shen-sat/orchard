In progress:

Mach B (Pause For A Minute):
- we should go over into game over screen on tap X
- there should be a tiny message at bottom of screen on game start saying "Press and hold X"
    - only when this is done do we deal card ie we block any other update until pause screen takes up whole screen (mid_x - 22, bottom - 17)
    - this box should be re-used for game over "Press X to continue"
- we shouldn't be able to move card unless X is pressed


------------------------------
Elevator pitch: remake Orchard in PICO-8

TODO:

Mach C (Points Mean Prizes!)
- requires aseprite mock
- score should be calculated at end, based on ages of planted fruits
- once last card pressed, any key press will bring up "Press X to continue" (use board from before)
- pressing X brings up same pause screen but now it displays:
    - fruit sprites with x number next to each one
    - final score
    - "Press X to see rank"
- pressing x again brings up rank on same board with rows of possible ranks https://gamerules.com/rules/orchard/
    - row will blink to indicate actual rank
    - - "Press X to see rank"
- pressing x again should take you back to MAIN TITLE

Mach D (SFX)
- growth "blops"
- card slide "shhh"
- card movement "bub" for rotate/"boob" for move
- card placement "flumf/floomf"
- pause "clack"
- start game tinkly "di di di di"

Mach E (Main Titles)
- requires aseprite mocks
    - https://saint11.org/img/pixel-tutorials/Vegetation.gif (leaves flaoting down)
    - https://saint11.org/img/pixel-tutorials/Wood.gif (trunk)
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdi8TdKJ4KE
- shintendo screen
- credits screen
    - code
    - graphics
    - sfx
    - music
    - special mentions:
        - gameplay taken from the titular board game
        - music adapted from Chris Zabriskie: We Always Thought The Future Would Be Kind 
- main screen
    - falling leaves animation
    - piles of fruit on ground
    - should include "A PICO-8 demake"
    - "Press X to start" should appear after a while, or on button X press
- each screen should "fade" into next. Google pico 8 examples for pseudo fade 

Mach E (Music To My Ears)
- yoga music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaoV1PrYft4
- starts playing on shintendo sign
- stops playing on pressing x to start game
- starts playing again once final card is placed

Other Mach:
- create a border - it should use the current trees placed to detremine maximum widths/heights
- stutter each fruit growth animation

Other:

- make card corners rounded
- corners of planted fruit could have tiny bits of grass poking in..?
- once last fruit is planted, have tiny critters move in
- points rise from grown fruit
- when x is pressed (ie pause screen is activated) all other updates/draws are skipped
- when player retries game, first notice should not be shown
