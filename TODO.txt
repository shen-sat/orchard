In progress:
Mach C (Points Mean Prizes!)
- take score from game into rank screen
- row will blink to indicate actual rank
    - first just make it white, to check it is working
    - then make it white


------------------------------
Elevator pitch: remake Orchard in PICO-8

TODO:



Mach D (SFX)
- growth "blops"
- card slide "shhh"
- card movement "bub" for rotate/"boob" for move
- card placement "flumf/floomf"
- pause "clack"
- start game tinkly "di di di di"

Mach E (Main Titles)
- requires aseprite mocks
    - https://saint11.org/img/pixel-tutorials/Vegetation.gif (leaves flaoting down)
    - https://saint11.org/img/pixel-tutorials/Wood.gif (trunk)
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdi8TdKJ4KE
- shentendo screen
- credits screen
    - code
    - graphics
    - sfx
    - music
    - special mentions:
        - gameplay taken from the titular board game
        - music adapted from Chris Zabriskie: We Always Thought The Future Would Be Kind 
- main screen
    - falling leaves animation
    - piles of fruit on ground
    - should include "A PICO-8 demake"
    - "Press X to start" should appear after a while, or on button X press
- each screen should "fade" into next. Google pico 8 examples for pseudo fade 
- pressing x on game over should take you back to MAIN TITLE

Mach E (Music To My Ears)
- yoga music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaoV1PrYft4
- starts playing on shintendo sign
- stops playing on pressing x to start game
- starts playing again once final card is placed

Other Mach:
- create a border - it should use the current trees placed to detremine maximum widths/heights
- stutter each fruit growth animation

Other:

- make card corners rounded
- corners of planted fruit could have tiny bits of grass poking in..?
- once last fruit is planted, have tiny critters move in
- points rise from grown fruit
- when x is pressed (ie pause screen is activated) all other updates/draws are skipped
- when player retries game, first notice should not be shown

------------------------------

DONE:
- create card
- move card
- create fruits
- place cards
- add ability to score
- major refactor
- place random first card in middle of orchard
- change rules so that cards can only be placed when overlapping fruit
- add age to fruit
- add tree sprites
- add lawn
- animations for fruit growth
- add solid card border
- add card slide animation
- change place card trigger: hold z and press down
