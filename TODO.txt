In progress:
- animations for tree sprites growth
    - look at the ghost in: https://saint11.org/img/pixel-tutorials/MotionBlur.gif
    - white first? Look at pedro's examples for ideas
    - should have a few leaves shoot up and then float down
    - maybe white, then squahses down into hoirontal rectangle, then shoots
    up into vertial rectangle, then rests as new tree..?
    - look at pixel art farm games
    - maybe look at on-hit animations?
    - don't go overboard! It's your first time, be kind :)

Elevator pitch: remake Orchard in PICO-8

TODO:
Next Mach:
- add solid (for now) card border
    - both borders can sit inside 16 x 32 grid - they only contain small seeds :)
- add card slide animation

Other Mach:
- change plant to hold z and press down
- change x to bring up a box (wooden signboard - go to town on this!) withs score/card no. 
- create a border - it should use the current trees placed to detremine maximum widths/heights
- create pseudo manual with control instructions for webpage that game is hosted on
    - mention edge-screen-scrolling!
    - with this we don't need an in-game tutorial, for now eh?
- Wooden sign game over screen with scores


- MUSIC
    - Sarah beth yoga https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaoV1PrYft4 (first song)

Other:

- bring up item select (fullscreen, draft version with just two cards for now)
- add "tattered" edges to card border
- corners of planted fruit could have tiny bits of grass poking in..?
- once last fruit is planted, have tiny critters move in
    - on arrow press, user can scroll
    - on any other key press bring up a box saying:
        - arrows to scroll
        - press and hold z and press down to see final score
- points rise from grown fruit
- text for how many cards left could be on wooden board in corner: https://saint11.org/img/pixel-tutorials/UI-9-Slice.gif
- title screen:
