Elevator pitch: remake Orchard in PICO-8

TODO:


Mach E (Music To My Ears)
- yoga music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaoV1PrYft4
- starts playing on shintendo sign
- stops playing on pressing x to start game
- starts playing again once final card is placed

Other Mach:
- create a border - it should use the current trees placed to detremine maximum widths/heights
- stutter each fruit growth animation

Other:

- make card corners rounded
- corners of planted fruit could have tiny bits of grass poking in..?
- once last fruit is planted, have tiny critters move in
- points rise from grown fruit
- when x is pressed (ie pause screen is activated) all other updates/draws are skipped
- when player retries game, first notice should not be shown

------------------------------
