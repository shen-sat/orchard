In progress:
Refactor code for drawing sprites
Get plants blinking again
Animations for tree sprites growth
- stutter each one


------------------------------
Elevator pitch: remake Orchard in PICO-8

TODO:
Mach A (Deal Me In):
- add solid (for now) card border
    - both borders can sit inside 16 x 32 grid - they only contain small seeds :)
- add card slide animation
    - should only happen when all growth animations finsihed
    - until card is dealt, block controls


Mach B (Pause For A Minute):
- requires aseprite mock https://saint11.org/img/pixel-tutorials/UI-9-Slice.gif
- change place card trigger: hold z and press down
- there should be a tiny board on game start saying "Press and hold X"
    - only when this is done do we deal card
- change hold x to bring up pause screen (wooden signboard - go to town on this!)
    - score/card no
    - tutorial text
        - controls
            - move card past edge of screen to scroll around orchard
        - grow your orchard by placing cards
        - to place a card, at least one of its fruit must overlap a matching fruit in the orchard
        - then list sprites and scores
            - seed = 0
            - bush = 1
            - sapling = 3
            - tree = 6

Mach C (Points Mean Prizes!)
- requires aseprite mock
- score should be calculated at end, based on ages of planted fruits
- once last card pressed, any key press will bring up "Press X to see score" board from bottom of screen
- pressing X brings up same board from pause screen but now it displays:
    - fruit sprites with x number next to each one
    - final score
    - "Press X to see rank"
- pressing x again brings up rank on same board with rows of possible ranks https://gamerules.com/rules/orchard/
    - row will blink to indicate actual rank
    - - "Press X to see rank"
- pressing x again should take you back to MAIN TITLE

Mach D (SFX)
- growth "blops"
- card slide "shhh"
- card movement "bub" for rotate/"boob" for move
- card placement "flumf/floomf"
- pause "clack"
- start game tinkly "di di di di"

Mach E (Main Titles)
- requires aseprite mocks
    - https://saint11.org/img/pixel-tutorials/Vegetation.gif (leaves flaoting down)
    - https://saint11.org/img/pixel-tutorials/Wood.gif (trunk)
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdi8TdKJ4KE
- shintendo screen
- credits screen
    - code
    - graphics
    - sfx
    - music
    - special mentions:
        - gameplay taken from the titular board game
        - music adapted from Chris Zabriskie: We Always Thought The Future Would Be Kind 
- main screen
    - falling leaves animation
    - piles of fruit on ground
    - should include "A PICO-8 demake"
    - "Press X to start" should appear after a while, or on button X press
- each screen should "fade" into next. Google pico 8 examples for pseudo fade 

Mach E (Music To My Ears)
- yoga music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaoV1PrYft4
- starts playing on shintendo sign
- stops playing on pressing x to start game
- starts playing again once final card is placed

Other Mach:
- create a border - it should use the current trees placed to detremine maximum widths/heights

Other:

- add "tattered" edges to card border
- corners of planted fruit could have tiny bits of grass poking in..?
- once last fruit is planted, have tiny critters move in
- points rise from grown fruit

------------------------------

DONE:
- create card
- move card
- create fruits
- place cards
- add ability to score
- major refactor
- place random first card in middle of orchard
- change rules so that cards can only be placed when overlapping fruit
- add age to fruit
