        - when time is finsihed, flag is switched
    - has main titles
        - need to work out position of all elements
        - after some time elapsed (or button X press) show "press start"
        - on press x (again), start game
    - then add fade in/fade out for all the above

Mach E (Main Titles)
- shentendo screen
- credits screen
    - code
    - graphics
    - sfx
    - music
    - special mentions:
        - gameplay taken from the titular board game
        - music adapted from Chris Zabriskie: We Always Thought The Future Would Be Kind 
- main screen
    - falling leaves animation
    - piles of fruit on ground
    - should include "A PICO-8 demake"
    - "Press X to start" should appear after a while, or on button X press
- each screen should "fade" into next. Google pico 8 examples for pseudo fade 
- pressing x on game over should take you back to MAIN TITLE

------------------------------
Elevator pitch: remake Orchard in PICO-8

TODO:

Mach D (SFX)
- growth "blops"
- card slide "shhh"
- card movement "bub" for rotate/"boob" for move
- card placement "flumf/floomf"
- pause "clack"
- start game tinkly "di di di di"


Mach E (Music To My Ears)
- yoga music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaoV1PrYft4
- starts playing on shintendo sign
- stops playing on pressing x to start game
- starts playing again once final card is placed

Other Mach:
- create a border - it should use the current trees placed to detremine maximum widths/heights
- stutter each fruit growth animation

Other:

- make card corners rounded
- corners of planted fruit could have tiny bits of grass poking in..?
- once last fruit is planted, have tiny critters move in
- points rise from grown fruit
- when x is pressed (ie pause screen is activated) all other updates/draws are skipped
- when player retries game, first notice should not be shown

------------------------------

- place cards
- add ability to score
