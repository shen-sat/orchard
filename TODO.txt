In progress:
- add age to fruit
    - to test:
        - make all the cards ALL berries
        - pick a card, and make it the starting card
        - pick a fruit within that card and make it its own variable
        (so you can refer to it later)
        - then plant over that selected fruit and print its age
            - make sure it caps at 6
    - you need to further refine `add(planted_fruits,fruit)` when you plant fruits 
        - because, if a card fruit has a matching planted fruit, you want to grow the planted fruit and discard the card fruit. BUT if the card fruit is plantable with no matching fruit then you should add it to planted fruits -- DONE

Elevator pitch: remake Orchard in PICO-8

TODO:



Other:
- create gifs with instructions for webpage that game is hosted on
    - mention this in-game 
    - mention edge-screen-scrolling
- bring up item select (fullscreen, draft version with just two cards for now)
- create a border - it should use the current trees placed to detremine maximum widths/heights 

--- notes on navigation

    - navigate orchard
- Z
    - Tap to rotate card

DONE:
- create card
